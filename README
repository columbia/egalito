Egalito is a binary recompiler, designed for implementing security hardening.
It uses a low-level intermediate representation (EIR or Chunk) that accurately
reflects all aspects of a program binary. Egalito uses metadata present in
modern position-independent binaries to turn all cross-references into EIR
Links, allowing code to be arbitrarily rearranged without additional overhead.
Output generation in the form of ELFs or union ELFs is supported, and Egalito
provides a custom loader that allows it to bootstrap into a fully self-hosted
environment (parsing and transforming libegalito.so).

Egalito supports x86_64 and aarch64, with experimental support for RISC-V.
